(Introduction) Demonstrating the t-test by simulating two collections (random numbers) built upon a specified mean and spread (standard deviation). Creating a data structure (DataFrame) from the generated collections and separating both collections into category. Visualisation of the data structure via categorical plot (seaborn) clearly shows both collections differ. Using two methods (i. scipy.stats and; ii. statsmodels.stats.weightstats) performing the actual t-test (determine the probability that the distribution from which the two generated collections had the same mean). The simulated (generated) collections demonstrate a probability of approximately zero or no chance both collections had an underlying distribution in which both had the same mean value because the simulation was setup like this. Running the statistical tests provide evidence that its reproducibly true. Even when both collections have been setup with the same mean value and if the probability is higher than the p-value cut-off of 5% then the statistical test does not provide any evidence the two collections are not centred around same point.\"\n",

Solution). (Introduction) Using matplotlib.pyplot plotting documentation example dataset (converting into an appropriate format beforehand). Once the x and y values are separated the plot appears to support the fact there exists two distinct groups of points. The KMeans algorithm determines if two distinct groups exist (allows for a human to be able to determine). Visually changed the colour of the second cluster to distinct both groups and added two new points to test KMeans. Using the KMeans prediction the new points are coloured according to associated (predicted) cluster. Plotting what the KMeans algorithm took as the centre of each clusters gives an indication how the algorithm came to its prediction.
