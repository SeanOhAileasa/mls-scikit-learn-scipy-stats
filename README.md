## Machine Learning & Statistics, Winter 21/22
### Due: last commit on or before January 2nd, 2022

Winter 21/22 assessment for the ``Machine Learning & Statistics`` module (5 Credits) of the ``Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics) (H.Dip)`` programme (75 Credits) at **Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT)**.

## Learning Outcomes

i. Describe the stochastic nature of real-world measurements. 

Stochastic is the opposite of deterministic. Something is deterministic if you know the outcome or can figure out the right outcome for definite ahead of time. Unfortunately, nothing is deterministic; therefore, almost everything is stochastic. Refers to events whereby chance is accepted.

ii. Select an appropriate mathematical model of a real-world problem.

Analysis of a real-world problem that might identify has a stochastic basis and some chance involved. On top of that, the next step is to determine the right way to look at that real-world problem. For example, is there a way to formulate or model it using an off-the-shelf Statistical or Machine Learning ``Python`` library to frame that problem correctly?

iii. Select an appropriate cost function for a given Machine Learning task.

The keyword here is optimisation, based on calculus, which is the basis for most Machine Learning. So, for example, having a function that measures the cost of something, is there a way to find the minimum cost resulting in the lowest possible priceâ€”selecting an appropriate cost function. The real-world problem is formulated in the correct terminology, identifying the correct parameters or setup, then applying Data Analytics (Machine Learning) techniques.

iv. Apply an optimisation technique to the parameters of a model.

The cost function is identified, then changing the problem's parameters to determine the cost. Finally, an optimisation technique is applied to the cost function to determine the minimum cost.

The terminology and concepts introduced thus far can be considered wordy and of a high level conceptually, but these can be nebulous. 

It turns out that it involved just one or two commands from a Machine Learning ``Python`` library, which does most of the heavy lifting for you. So it's the formulation of the problem, the way you look at it, in terms of Machine Learning etc that's important. It is how to set up the model and then apply one of the off-the-shelf techniques to get the desired results.

#### Use ``binder``

This repository can be interacted in an executable environment, making the code immediately reproducible for experimentation using ``Docker`` in the background. The ``Binder`` badge creates a virtual machine in the cloud that runs the Jupyter Notebook enabling live interaction. Note it does not change the original Jupyter Notebook as it cannot sync with GitHub. The ``requirements.txt`` (``Python`` convention) file includes the packages required to run each Jupyter Notebook.

## Instructions

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure the module's learning outcomes are achieved while also providing sample work to show prospective employers. The overall assessment is split into the three components detailed below.

#### i. GitHub Repository:

Containing two Jupyter Notebooks described further down and in addition to:

- A clear and informative ``README.md`` explaining why the repository exists, what is in it, and how to run the notebooks.

- A ``requirements.txt`` file enables someone to quickly run the notebooks with minimal configuration. Of course, also include any required files such as data files and image files.

#### ii. [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb) ``sklearn`` Jupyter Notebook [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats/HEAD?labpath=scikit-learn.ipynb):

- A clear and concise overview of the ``scikit-learn`` library.

- Demonstrate three interesting ``scikit-learn`` algorithms. The choice may be based on the module content or otherwise - may have an overall spread of examples across the library or pick a particularly interesting part.

- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

###### Motivation

Initially, I proposed to apply the three algorithms of interest (Machine Learning) to ``Cybersecurity`` problems. However, given the background knowledge required by viewers of the Jupyter Notebook, instead focused on the overall objective of ensuring the module's learning outcomes are achieved (best done by using the datasets introduced).

###### Description

- The Jupyter Notebook is organised in four parts (including the ``Conclusion``):

i. The ``Abstract`` provides a clear and concise overview of the ``scikit-learn`` library and introduces an outline of the core ``Machine Learning`` problems.

ii. The ``Introduction`` serves as the foundation for introducing ``Machine Learning`` (emphasis on ``regression``) without reference to the ``scikit-learn`` library.

``Regression`` is an overarching idea within ``Machine Learning`` and ``scikit-learn`` [10]. Given this fact, this Jupyter Notebook ``Introduction`` first presents a simple data-driven problem to demonstrate the practice of:

i. data collection; 

ii. descriptive statistics; 

iii. correlation; 

iv. data visualisation; 

v. model building; 

vi. extrapolation and regression analysis [11].

The ``Introduction`` will intentional not use the ``scikit-learn`` library as this will form the baseline of knowledge required to understand the algorithms presented.

iii. The ``Solution`` is subdivided into the demonstrations of the core ``Machine Learning`` problems (``scikit-learn`` algorithms of interest).

First, analysing the example code from the ``sklearn`` documentation with a follow up of a simulated or analysis of a simple dataset.

#### iii. [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb) ``scipy.stats`` Jupyter Notebook [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats/HEAD?labpath=scipy-stats.ipynb):

- A clear and concise overview of the ``scikit-stats`` library.

- An example hypothesis test using ``ANOVA``. The dataset used must be appropriate to use ``ANOVA``, ensuring the assumptions underlying ``ANOVA`` are met, and then perform and display the results of ``ANOVA`` using ``scipy.stats``.

- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers [0].

###### Motivation

From medical studies to research experiments, from polling organizations to United Nations observers and ``Cybersecurity``, data is being collected everywhere and all the time. Knowledge in statistics provides the tools and conceptual foundations in quantitative reasoning to extract information intelligently from this sea of data.

###### Description

- The Jupyter Notebook is organised in four parts:

i. The ``Abstract`` provides a clear and concise overview of the ``scipy-stats`` library.

ii. The ``Introduction`` serves as the foundation for introducing ``ANOVA`` (emphasis on ``t-test``) using the ``scipy-stats`` library with a simulated dataset.

An analysis of collections ``a`` and ``b`` uses a specific type of ``t-test`` called the ``Independent Samples T-Test``, which assumes the numbers in the collections ``a`` and ``b`` are different (not related) [6]. For example, an ``Independent Samples T-Test`` might give vaccine ``a`` to a particular group and vaccine ``b``to one specific group and then compares the two groups [6]. 

The ``Paired T-test`` is when the collection of numbers depend on one another, and an example is represented in the ``Appendix`` [6]. This type of test is helpful in scenarios such as a teaching environment. Teaching primary school children some topic and determining if they had learned anything about the subject, the teacher might: i. give a standardised test before the lesson; ii. present the lesson, and iii. do another standardised test; pairing the numbers before and after the class for each student (have a pair of numbers for each student) [6]

iii. The ``Solution`` builds upon the ``Introduction`` by highlighting the shortcoming of the ``t-test`` when there are multiple samples (more than two).

Demonstrating ``ANOVA`` by first experimenting with the ``scipy-stats.f_oneway`` documentation example code, then using the [[``Flavors of Cacao``](http://flavorsofcacao.com/)] dataset created by [[``R. Tatman``](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings)] and uploaded to Kaggle in August 2017.

## Installation

- Require ``Python`` to be loaded on your local machine. Recommend downloading and installing Anaconda.

https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Execute Jupyter Notebook

- The software must be downloaded and run on a machine as follows:

	- Clone the repository with the following command:

	``git clone https://github.com/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats.git``

  - Run Jupyter Notebooks from the command line with the following:

	``jupyter notebook``

  - Open notebook - ``scikit-learn.ipynb``
  
  - Open notebook - ``scipy-stats.ipynb``  

  - Once running within the Jupyter environment can navigate with ease - links are plentiful.

	- ***Notebook links will not work on github given that github renders as static HTML - also not able to view equation tag numbers. Please run on a local machine or use nbviewer (see below).***

- An alternative to downloading and running on a local machine with all features included (links/equation tag number etc) can view via [[``scikit-learn``](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb)][[``scipy-stats``](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb)].
