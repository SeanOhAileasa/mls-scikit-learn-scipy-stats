## Machine Learning & Statistics, Winter 21/22
### Due: last commit on or before December 19th, 2021

Winter 21/22 assessment for the ``Machine Learning & Statistics`` module (5 Credits) of the ``Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics) (H.Dip)`` programme (75 Credits) at **Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT)**.

***
## Instructions
***

### Topic: [``scikit-learn``](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb)

- Overview of the ``scikit-learn`` Python library.


- Demonstrations of three interesting ``scikit-learn`` algorithms.


- Using plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

### Topic: [``scipy-stats``](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb)

- Overview of the ``scipy-stats`` Python library.


- Perform a hypothesis test using ``ANOVA`` on an appropriate dataset and ensuring the appropriate underlying ``ANOVA`` are met, then perform and display the results using ``scipy-stats``.


- Using plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

## Prerequisites

- Require Python to be loaded on your local machine. Recommend downloading and installing Anaconda.

https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Execute Jupyter Notebook

- The software must be downloaded and run on a machine as follows:

	- Clone the repository with the following command:

	``git clone https://github.com/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats.git``

    - Run Jupyter Notebooks from the command line with the following:

	``jupyter notebook``

    - Open notebook - ``scikit-learn.ipynb``
    
    - Open notebook - ``scipy-stats.ipynb``    

    - Once running within the Jupyter environment can navigate with ease - links are plentiful.

	- ***Notebook links will not work on github given that github renders as static HTML - also not able to view equation tag numbers. Please run on a local machine or use nbviewer (see below).***

- An alternative to downloading and running on a local machine with all features included (links/equation tag number etc) can view via [[``scikit-learn``](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb)][[``scipy-stats``](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn-scipy-stats/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb)].
